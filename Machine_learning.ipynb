        "- A parameter is a variable that defines a system or a function and can influence its behavior or output. In the context of statistical models and machine learning, parameters are often the coefficients or weights that the model learns from the training data. They help to shape the model's predictions based on the input features.\n",

        "Q2. What is correlation?\n",
        " What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "- Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables. It is typically quantified using a correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1. A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. For example, if there is a negative correlation between temperature and heating costs, it suggests that as temperature rises, heating costs tend to fall.\n",

        "- The loss value quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual outcomes. It is calculated using a loss function, which measures the difference between predicted values and true values. A lower loss value indicates that the model is making more accurate predictions, while a higher loss value suggests that the model is not performing well. By monitoring the loss value during training, one can determine if the model is improving and whether adjustments are needed.\n",
